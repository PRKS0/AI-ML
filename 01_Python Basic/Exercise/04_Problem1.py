# ðŸ§© Problem 1: The Animal Kingdom
# Concepts: Basic inheritance, method overriding

# Create a base class Animal with:

# A method make_sound() that prints "Some generic animal sound".

# Then create two derived classes:

# Dog that overrides make_sound() to print "Bark!"

# Cat that overrides make_sound() to print "Meow!"

# Finally, write a function that takes a list of animals and calls their make_sound() method.

# Goal: Understand overriding and how inheritance helps simplify code reuse.
